This is the game I created for my midterm. The game is called Light in the Darkness, where the player is a bright yellow shadowling in a dark, grey world called Gloomy Gallows. The leader of this kingdom is called the King of Shadows. However, he isn't a nice king. One day, the King of Shadows start to absorb every single shadowling's souls to make himself more powerful. It's up to the player to stop him and make some friends along the way.
